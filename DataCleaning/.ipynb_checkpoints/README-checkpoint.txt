The code in this dossier can be used to clean Chandra data -- the tools here were tailored for studying galaxy clusters. 

To run the main cleaning code, I suggest using the DataCleaning.ipynb. If you would prefer not to use a notebook, you can adapt one of the input files (or create a new one) with your specifications (see Perseus.i for an example). Once you have your input file (say it is called myCluster.i), you can execute the code with the following command:
`python DataCleaningPipeline.py myCluster.i`

Be sure to have ciao installed!
